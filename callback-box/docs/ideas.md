# Ideas & Planned Features

## Claude Code Memory Concerns

Auto-memory (`~/.claude/projects/<path-hash>/memory/`) is problematic:

- Path-hash-based and machine-specific -- not portable across machines
- Not version-controlled, easily lost if repo moves
- Custom subagents don't inherit CLAUDE.md or `.claude/rules/` (only built-in subagents do)
- No setting to relocate memory into the project repo
- Open feature request: [anthropics/claude-code#25739](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/25739)

Durable project knowledge should go in repo files (CLAUDE.md, docs/), not auto-memory.

## Feature Ideas

### Calendar integration

Google Calendar sync via .ics files, CLI queries, potential cron via RRULE. See [calendar-plan.md](../docs/calendar-plan.md) if it exists.

### Agent "give up" mechanism

Agent writes `.callback-box/agent-failure.json` with `{ reason, phase, sessionId }` to signal it can't complete. Caller detects, reverts uncommitted changes, logs failure. Prevents half-finished work from being committed.

### Chat assistant as job dispatcher

The chat frontend's system prompt should instruct the assistant to use jobs to start tasks rather than executing them synchronously. Also provide it with docs and CLI query tools to check: what's currently running, what's scheduled to run, when something last ran.

### Documentation graph

Build a graph of all docs (stack-decisions, testing-gaps, generated docs, CLAUDE.md files, memory files, etc.), detect orphans, visualize cross-references. Ensure no doc is unreachable and understand the reference structure.

### Voice keyword for photo capture

Add a keyword trigger during voice input (especially the Dropbox long recording mode) that captures a photo from the camera. Useful for annotating voice notes with visual context.

### Image card EXIF date extraction

When processing image cards, extract the date taken from EXIF data (DateTimeOriginal) rather than relying on file timestamps, which are unreliable after syncing/copying.
