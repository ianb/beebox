The chat frontend's system prompt should instruct the assistant to *dispatch jobs* to start tasks rather than executing them synchronously inside the chat turn. Plus give the assistant CLI query tools + docs to check: what's currently running, what's scheduled, when something last ran. This makes long-running work feel responsive in chat (assistant reports "I've queued X", user can ask "what's running?") and keeps the chat session from holding resources.
