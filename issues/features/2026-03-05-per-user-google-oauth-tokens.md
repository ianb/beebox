Currently Google connector tokens are stored per-box in a single `google.secret.json`. Any box user should be able to connect their own Google account. This means per-user token storage (e.g., keyed by email), knowing which user's tokens to use for which operations, and the OAuth callback tracking which user initiated the flow.
