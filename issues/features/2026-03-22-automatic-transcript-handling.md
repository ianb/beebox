title: "Automatic transcript handling in schema instructions"

Several card type instructions (memo, audio, capture-session) include details about transcription handling (checking for `<transcription>`, skipping untranscribed audio, etc.). This should ideally be handled automatically by the processing pipeline rather than requiring agents to understand transcription state. The schema instructions should focus on describing the card's content and structure, not transcription machinery.
