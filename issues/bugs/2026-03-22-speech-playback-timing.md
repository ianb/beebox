title: "Speech playback timing"

Currently TTS speech doesn't play until the full response is complete (or at least a significant chunk). This means the "speak before doing work" pattern in the chat system prompt doesn't actually work as intended — the user hears the speech and sees the results at the same time, not speech-first. Investigate whether streaming partial speech playback is feasible so the user hears "Let me look into that" before tool calls start executing.
